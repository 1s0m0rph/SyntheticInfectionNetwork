	<same as work, but people will go here when they are sick and leave when they are better>

in public
    traveling
        (continue doing that)
    otherwise, this acts just like any "otherwise" location

** - they will eventually stop since they need to sleep. in particular, the probability we stop every time step is simply g(affinity) = 1 - affinity (this is also a poisson with parameter 1/g(affinity)
