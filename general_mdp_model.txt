* - in particular, use simply 1/<avg time> for every time step (this generates a poisson distribution with parameter 1/<avg time>)
** - they will eventually stop since they need to sleep. in particular, the probability we stop every time step is simply g(affinity) = 1 - affinity (this is also a poisson with parameter 1/g(affinity)
